# Sign-up-Newsletter
A simple Newsletter Signup that does not actually send a newsletter.

This application was made with Node.js Express.js, Bootstrap, and the Mailchimp API.

The purpose of this application is to collect a clients first name, last name, and email. That email will then be stored inside the Mailchimp database for my "business". If the information has been stored successfully, the client will be greeted with a success page. If there was an error, the client will be notified and given a button to return to the homepage to try again.
